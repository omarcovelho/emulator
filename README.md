## Introduction

This emulator project was inspired by the concepts explained in J Clark Scott's book *"[But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone](https://amzn.to/4dt211m)"*. The emulator is designed to simulate basic computer operations, providing an educational tool for understanding how computers work at a fundamental level.

The project is implemented in Java, using design patterns like Observer and Strategy to ensure modularity and flexibility. It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to dive deeper into computer architecture and operation.

## Features

- **Basic Instruction Set**: Emulates fundamental instructions such as load, store, add, and subtract.
- **Memory Management**: Simulates memory allocation and management.
- **Processor Simulation**: Mimics the operations of a simple CPU.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or modify the emulator with new features or instructions.
- **Observer Pattern**: Keeps track of state changes and notifies other components.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows for different algorithms or behaviors to be added easily.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The main programming language used to build the emulator.
- **Design Patterns**: 
  - **Observer Pattern**: Used to handle event-driven programming and state changes.
  - **Strategy Pattern**: Applied for flexible and interchangeable algorithm implementations.
